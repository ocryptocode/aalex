2. **Microphone not working**
   - Check microphone permissions in Windows settings
   - Ensure microphone is set as default recording device

3. **Voice recognition not accurate**
   - Speak clearly and at normal volume
   - Reduce background noise
   - Adjust microphone sensitivity in Windows

4. **TTS not working**
   - Check if speakers are working
   - Verify Windows TTS is enabled
   - Try different voice options in the code

### Performance Tips
- Close unnecessary applications for better performance
- Use a good quality microphone for better recognition
- Speak clearly and wait for the beep before giving commands

## Security Notes

- AALEX runs locally on your computer
- Voice data is processed by Google Speech Recognition (sent over internet)
